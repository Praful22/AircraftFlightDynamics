# AircraftFlightDynamics

Let's start by looking at an aircraft and its controls.

Coordinate Frame: Body-axes coordinate system.

Assumptions:
1. Aircraft is treated as a rigid body whose dynamics are comprised of three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, hence 6-DoF motion.
2. Body axes coordinate frame is fixed at the aircraft center of gravity (CG),

Motion can be described by:
1. Translational Motion:
  a.
  b.
  c.


2. Rotational Motion:
  a.
  b.
  c.
