# AircraftFlightDynamics

Let's start by looking at **an aircraft and its controls.**

What is **an aircraft**?

Ans: "Craft or vessel which navigates through the air."

What are **aircraft controls**?

Ans: Means by which a pilot or an autopilot controls the direction and attitude(roll, pitch, yaw) of an aircraft in flight.

What is looking at something?

Ans: Clear and pure observation through eyes(brain).

**Coordinate Frame: Body-axes coordinate system.**

What is a **coordinate frame**?

Ans: To describe any phenomenon of a system (single/multiple particle system or a field), one must choose a set of coordinates to uniquely determine its positions on a manifold or a frame. This frame is called a coordinate frame. 

What is a **body-axes coordinate system**?

Ans: A coordinate system fixed to the airplane. The origin is at the center of gravity; the x-axis is in the airplane plane of symmetry and points out the nose of the airplane; the z-axis is in the plane of symmetry and points downward, and the y-axis is perpendicular to the x and z axes and points out the right wing.

**Assumptions:**
What are **assumptions**? 

-> 

1. Aircraft is treated as a rigid body whose dynamics are comprised of three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, hence 6-DoF motion.

2. Body axes coordinate frame is fixed at the aircraft's center of gravity (CG),

Motion can be described by:
1. Translational Motion:
  a.
  b.
  c.


2. Rotational Motion:
  a.
  b.
  c.
